To generate .exe files, simply navigate to the root project folder and run the makefile by running
```make``` in the command line. You will need to make sure that you are running the command in a command line environment that has access to the [Microsoft C++ toolset](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/building-on-the-command-line?view=msvc-170).
