# asm

This project contains two directories that contain assembly language examples for both the [Netwide Assembler](https://www.nasm.us/xdoc/2.15.05/nasmdoc.pdf) as well as the [Microsoft Macro Assembler](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/assembler/masm/microsoft-macro-assembler-reference?view=msvc-170). 

The assemblers in this repository will be targetting the x86_64 architecture.
